# ShadowSpill Progress

Last updated: 2026-08-10

## Current milestone

Phase 1 — canonical IR and serialization.

## Status

- [x] Fresh repository and independent Conda environment created.
- [x] Repository-local commit identity configured.
- [x] PyTorch 2.13.0+cu130 and editable external `mlops` verified on the RTX
  5090.
- [x] Public naming, dependency direction, and physical-budget contracts
  documented.
- [x] Compact legacy-oracle evidence frozen with source hashes.
- [x] Clean build, wheel, test, naming, and dependency-isolation gates pass.

## Completed gates

### Phase 0

- Editable and isolated wheel builds succeed through scikit-build-core.
- Python tests and 90% coverage gate pass.
- Ruff lint/format and strict mypy pass.
- C11 warnings-as-errors build and CTest canary pass.
- Production naming and old-repository dependency audits pass.
- External oracle executes only in a separate process with a sanitized Python
  environment.

## Gate rule

No later phase is declared active until the current phase passes all of its
tests and is committed. Unexpected findings and design changes are recorded in
the ignored internal progress log before this tracked summary is updated.
